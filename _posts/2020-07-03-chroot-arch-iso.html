    Simply put, I messed up installing Archlinux and my system didn't have internet so I couldn't do anything. This is the way I solved it.

            For once in a long time, I had some trouble setting up WiFi and Ethernet in my Archlinux installation. After finishing and rebooting to the actual system, I couldn't get up dhcp, and neither wifi-menu (netctl) nor network-manager were installed so I didn't have any means to connect to the web and install needed packages. What a vicious circle.

           What I had to do was quite simple really: grab again the bootable USB that I used to install the system in the first place, boot it into the installer and then mount my partitions. These are the partitions I created in the installation process, in my case root and home:
           
            <div class="code-caption"><span>mount /dev/sda1 /mnt</span></div>
           
            <div class="code-caption"><span>mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/home</span></div>
           
           Then, chroot into it:
           
            <div class="code-caption"><span>arch-chroot /mnt</span></div>
           
           Now, you're inside your system as root. In my case, I used iwctl to connect to my WiFi (I used to use wifi-menu, I swear it came in the iso, but it didn't this time). Run "ip a" and get the name of your wireless interface, and connect to your wifi:
           
            <div class="code-caption"><span>station wlp01 scan</span></div>
            <div class="code-caption"><span>station wlp01 get-networks</span></div>
            <div class="code-caption"><span>station wlp01 connect YOUR_WIFI_SSID</span></div>
           
           And you'll be prompted to enter the password. After that I rebooted into my actual system, and I was already able to download packages, so I just downloaded networkmanager from pacman. And that's all, having an internet connection I could install everything I needed:
