I'm a software engineer, primarily interested in creating modern and performant web applications. Heavily focused in
code simplicity and clean code.

This site is built using Jekyll, themed with a modification of minima. The code theme is gruvbox.dark.

The header image is a sunset over CÃ¡diz, one of the southernmost points of mainland Europe. Every picture you can find
here has been taken by me, if not stated otherwise.
